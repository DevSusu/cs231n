# Lec01: Course Intro

### Importance of Computer Vision & Bursting amount of data
Trivial

### History of 'Vision'
* Camera
* Eyes - Signal to brain
* Computer Vision
  * Block World
  * Generalized Cylinder
    * Every object is composed of simple geometric shapes
  * Pictorial Structure
  * Object Segmentation
    * if object recognition is hard, how about Grouping pixels that are related
  * Face detection
  * SIFT - matching two same images
    * Idea of matching object's 'main feature'
  * Spatial Pyramid Matching
  * Visual Object Challenge, image-net.org
    * More base data, more categories, thus less overfitting
    * Now has less error rate than Stanford Ph.D student

### cs231n Overview
* Focuses on image classification - very basic, generalized techniques
* Convolutional Neural Networks
  * winner of imagenet challenge
  * Breakthrough of dramatic performance boost 2012 ~
  * has been studied from 1998
  * why has this only been spotlighted during few years?
    * computing power increase
    * increase of available labeled data
* Future Challenges are tremendous!
  * Visual genome, ...
  * 0.5 second of magic. Human writes a paragraph from 0.5s of image
  * We can laugh from a image if understanding the background and all

### Philosophy
* Understand how to write from scratch, debug, train CNN
* Learn practical techniques (Caffe, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* Fun topics such as RNN, DeepDream, NeuralStye, ...
